# Mainframe Technologies Applied Project
For my applied project for Mainframe Technologies LYIT course, I am required to pick a mainframe technology of my choice and develop an application based on that technology. The application I have decided to do is an COBOL DB2 report program. This COBOL program will query data from a DB2 database using embedded SQL and produce an output report. I have created a customer table and an invoice table in the database. The customer table is related to the invoice table using the customer ID number as the foreign key. I have used a cursor in my COBOL program to be able to query data from multiple tables.
